= About =

Oftalmotron is an open-source project composed by a toolkit to integrate eye-tracking technology in 3D interactive applications and some example programs.
The applications and the library are meant to be used in research activities.

The eye tracking hardware currently used is Tobii T60, with a freely redistributable SDK (see [http://oftalmotron.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/tobii-redist-manual.pdf doc/tobii-redist-manual.pdf]).
The 3D engine of the applications will be based on [http://www.openscenegraph.org OpenSceneGraph (OSG)] or just [http://www.opengl.org OpenGL].

The software is developed in C++ and currently limited to Windows platform, because of the
restriction imposed by the Tobii SDK. All source code is released under the GPL license.
