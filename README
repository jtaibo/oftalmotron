Description
===========

The target of this project is to develop applications that test the use of eye tracking
technology in 3D interactive applications, for research purposes.

The eye tracking used is Tobii, with a freely redistributable SDK (see doc/tobii-redist-manual.pdf).
The 3D engine of the applications will be based on OpenSceneGraph (OSG) or just OpenGL.

It is developed in C++ and currently limited to Windows platform, because of the
restriction imposed by the Tobii SDK.
