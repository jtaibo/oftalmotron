**Oftalmolib** is an eye-tracking abstraction layer that allows applications to access the gaze information to be used in real-time.

NOTE: The "abstraction layer" is currently no more than "good intentions". As the only available implementation is the one using Tobii SDK, the superclass is left as future work to homogenize the different APIs.
